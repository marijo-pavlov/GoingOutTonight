###User Stories: 
- As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
- As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
- As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
- As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

Used **Yelp API** to find venues in the cities.
